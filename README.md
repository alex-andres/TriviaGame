#H1 Trivial Philosophy

This trivia game uses javascript, html and css to allow a user to take a 10 question quiz on some notable western philosophers. The game provides users with a quote from the respective philosopher and drawing for a correct answer and provides the correct answer and drawing for the incorrect answer. At the end of the game the user is able to see his/her score.

Later features will include video links to the youtube page School of Life where the users can watch short videos that provide them a brief background on the philosophers who were referenced in the questions the user got wrong.
